The provided code is a Python script for a simple Student Gradebook application. It utilizes dictionaries to manage student data and their scores. Below is an explanation of the code:

Functionalities of functions:
1. show_intro():
   - This function prints a welcome message and introduces the topic of the day, which is dictionaries, and states the purpose of the app, which is to manage student scores.

2. Gradebook Dictionary:
   - gradebook = { }: Initializes an empty dictionary called gradebook where student names are keys and their scores (a list of integers) are values.

3. show_menu():
   - This function displays the menu options available in the Gradebook app. The user can choose from options to add, update, delete students, view all students, calculate averages, or to exit.

4. add_student():
   - Prompts the user to enter a student's name and their marks as a comma-separated string.
   - Converts the input string into a list of integers and adds this data to the gradebook dictionary.
   - Handles invalid input using a try-except block to ensure all entered marks are numbers.

5. update_marks():
   - Allows updating a student's marks if they exist in the gradebook, if not there gives error.
   - asks for new marks and updates the student's record in the dictionary.
   - Uses exception handling to validate that only numbers are entered.

6. delete_student():
   - Deletes a student's record from the gradebook if the student exists, else gives error.
   - Prints confirmation of deletion or an error message if the student is not found.

7. view_all():
   - Displays all student records in the gradebook.
   - If there are no records, it notifies the user that there are no student records yet.

8. calculate_average():
   - Calculates and prints the average marks for a specified student if they exist in the gradebook.
   - Handles cases where no marks are present or if the student is not found.

9. main():
   - This is the main loop of the application. It shows the introduction and continuously displays the menu until the user chooses to exit.
   - Based on user input, it calls the appropriate function to perform actions like adding, updating, deleting students, viewing all records, calculating averages, or exiting the application.

10. Starting point: 
   - The script is designed to run when executed directly. The conditional if __name__ == "__main__": main() ensures that main() is called only when the script is run as a standalone program, not when imported as a module.

Key Concepts
- Dictionaries: Used to store and manage student data efficiently with keys (student names) and values (lists of marks).
- Exception Handling: Ensures best input processing by catching errors when converting strings to integers.
- Functions: Modularizes code into reusable blocks for each operation (add, update, delete, view, calculate).
- User Interaction: Uses input/output to interact with users and perform operations based on their choices.

What I've learnt:
- Dictionary: Python dictionaries are unordered collection of key-value paired, mutable and indexed by keys.
- dictionaies are represented in { key : value }.
- Dictionaries can store / hold any datatype like numeric, string, boolean, tuple, sets, list and nested dictionaries.
- Dictionaries are key-value paired
- Dictionaries are mutable means we can add, change or remove items after dictionary is created.
- The keys must be unique and immutable (cannot be changed once created), but values can be duplicated and mutable.
- Dictionaries are dynamic size means automatically resizes as we add / remove elements.
- So, finally dictionaies are useful for; ast data access, highly flexible, dynamic and mutable, won't allows duplicate keys,
  useful for counting / grouping data
  supports mathematical set operations (i.e difference, union, intersection) and useful for deduplication (eliminates the repeated entries from sequences).
- Some disadvantages of dictionaies are; more memory usage (due to it stores in key-value pairs along with hashing info), no diect indexing and 
  slower for small data sets.
